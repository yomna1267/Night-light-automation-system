This system automatically turns on the light at night when someone enters the room.
##### components:
- Ultrasonic and servo motor to detect the motion in the room.
- Photoresistor(LDR) to detect whether we are during the day or at night.
- LEDs to be tur on at night.
##### simulation
If you don't have the above components, this is a link for system simulation.

just click on tinker this then start simulation.

after that you can try the system by controlling the lighting, the object close to the sensor.
